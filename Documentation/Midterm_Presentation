Midterm Presentation:

Functional Requirements:
  
Non-Functional Requirements:

Unusual Constraints:
  Raspberry Pi doesn't have an internal clock, so we have to manually set the clock every power cycle.

Class Diagram:

Challenges in implementing design:
  Different hardware versions
  Outdated libraries
  Finding a browser that supports all needed features
  Creating a first time run script that installs all needed components

Client Relationship:
  Hes terrible yet also great

Major Challenges:
  Working around clock reset
  First time network configuration
  Sensor integration
  Discovering monitor resolution  ~an ongoing struggle
  Finding a mirrored film with correct properties
  
Lessons Learned:
  Use properly sized memory device the first time
  Measure twice, cut once
  
Unsolved Problems:
  Pandora integration
  Dynamic animated background
  Screen control via light sensor/motion sensor

Will you finish on time? 
  Yes
  
Have we altered the scope?
  A music player was initially included, and probably will not make it to V1.0
